=head1 METHODS

=head2 delete

Rows in this table should not be deleted so we overload
L<DBIx::Class::Row/delete> to throw an exception.

NOTE: if L<DBIx::Class::ResultSet/delete> is called on a result set then this
overloaded method is bypassed. Please consider using
L<DBIx::Class::ResultSet/delete_all> instead. Of course we also cannot prevent
deletes performed outside DBIx::Class control.

    shift->result_source->schema->throw_exception(
        "OrderlinesShipping rows cannot be deleted");
}
