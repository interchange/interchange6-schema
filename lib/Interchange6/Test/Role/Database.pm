Database backend version and other interesting info (if available).  We expect a database-specific role to supply the builder.

sub _build_database_info {
    return "no info";
}

=head2 dbd_version

DBD::Foo version string. We expect a database-specific role to supply the builder.

=cut

has dbd_version => (
    is => 'lazy',

=head2 schema_class

Defaults to Interchange6::Schema. This gives tests the normal expected schema but allows them to overload with some other test schema if desired.

);

=head2 ic6s_schema

Our connected and deployed schema,
