Interchange6 test layout
========================

Most tests use Test::Roo with individual test roles residing under:

t/lib/Test

Please follow this pattern for tests that can be run against multiple
database backends.

NOTE: test role execution is NOT deterministic so make sure you cleanup
carefully and whenever possible DO NOT call ->clear_all_fixtures.

The tests are run by the following test scripts:

t/test_mysql.t
t/test_postgresql.t
t/test_sqlite.t

These test scripts will consume all test roles found under t/lib/Test.

If you want to run only specific test roles you can does this via ENV. For
example to only run Test::Message test role you can do something like:

TEST_ROLE_ONLY=Message prove -v -l -m t/test_sqlite.t

Multiple test roles can be selected thus (notice no spaces between commas):

TEST_ROLE_ONLY=Message,Media prove -v -l -m t/test_sqlite.t
