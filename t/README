Interchange6 test layout
========================

Most tests use Test::Roo with individual test roles residing under:

t/lib/Test

Please follow this pattern.

The tests are run by the following test scripts:

t/test_mysql.t
t/test_postgresql.t
t/test_sqlite.t

Every time a test role is added under Test:: it must also be added  to each of these test scripts.
